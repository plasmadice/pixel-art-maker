# Pixel Art Maker Project

This is my(Herman White's) version of the Pixel Art Maker for the udacity Grow with Google scholarship challenge.

I have previously made a pixel art maker of sorts at https://plasmadice.github.io/etch-a-sketch/ and with that it was a bit easier to do this project.

What I learned:

-Event listeners can be disabled
-Javascript libraries make things easier to remember and write
